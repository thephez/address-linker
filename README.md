Address Linker
==============

Scans an input CSV file and creates a SQLite DB containing the addresses, assigned account name, if it is "owned by me" (i.e. it came from the CSV), number of transactions associated with the address, and the current balance. It also adds an entry in the database for any addresses that have interacted (as part of either an input or output transaction).
